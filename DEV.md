Step 1 - Platform Decision & Initial Setup
-> Choose between Flask+ngrok vs Vercel deployment approaches based on your preferences
-> Flask+ngrok: Easier Python integration, simpler backend development, instant local testing with public URL
-> Vercel: Better production scaling, seamless Git integration, but requires API routes or separate backend
-> Recommendation: Start with Flask+ngrok for rapid prototyping, migrate to Vercel later for production
-> Set up local development environment with Python, Flask, and basic project structure
-> Initialize Git repository for version control from day one
-> Domain purchase can wait until final deployment - use ngrok subdomain or Vercel's free domains initially
-> Vercel CLI allows instant deployment from command line, but Flask gives more control during development

Step 2 - Supabase Backend Configuration
-> Create free Supabase project and note connection credentials
-> Configure authentication settings to enable Google OAuth provider
-> Design user table with fields for user ID, email, display name, creation timestamp, API usage tracking
-> Create teams table with fields for team ID, user ID, team name, prompt text, AI response, feedback status, creation timestamp
-> Set up Row Level Security policies to ensure users only access their own data
-> Test database connection and basic CRUD operations using Supabase client library
-> Configure API usage tracking table for monitoring user requests and implementing rate limiting

Step 3 - Basic Flask Application Structure
-> Create main Flask application file with route definitions for all required pages
-> Set up template directory structure for HTML files and static directory for CSS/JS assets
-> Configure Flask session management for user authentication state
-> Install required dependencies: Flask, Supabase client, requests for API calls
-> Create base HTML template with common navigation and styling elements
-> Set up environment variables for Supabase credentials and Google OAuth configuration
-> Implement basic error handling and logging for debugging during development

Step 4 - Google OAuth Authentication Flow
-> Register application with Google Cloud Console and obtain OAuth client credentials
-> Implement OAuth login route that redirects to Google authorization URL
-> Create callback route to handle Google's authorization response and exchange code for tokens
-> Store user session data and sync with Supabase user table on successful authentication
-> Add logout functionality that clears session and redirects to login page
-> Implement authentication decorator to protect routes requiring login
-> Add user profile display showing basic information from Google account

Step 5 - Core Frontend Pages Development
-> Create login page with Google sign-in button and basic styling
-> Build homepage displaying user's API usage statistics, recent teams list, and "Create New Team" button
-> Develop team creation page with text input form for natural language prompts
-> Design prior teams page showing saved teams in table/card format with feedback submission options
-> Implement legal disclaimer modal that appears on first homepage visit with acceptance tracking
-> Add basic CSS styling for consistent appearance across all pages without fancy elements
-> Include navigation between pages and proper form validation for user inputs

Step 6 - Dummy AI Integration Backend
-> Create AI processing function that returns formatted mock response: "I have received your prompt: [user_input]"
-> Implement team creation workflow: save prompt to database, call dummy AI function, store mock response
-> Add API usage tracking that increments counter for each team creation request
-> Create feedback submission system that updates team records with user practice results
-> Implement data retrieval functions for displaying user's saved teams and statistics
-> Add basic error handling for database operations and user feedback messages
-> Set up logging system to track application usage and debug issues during development

Step 7 - Data Flow Integration & Testing
-> Connect all frontend forms to backend processing functions with proper error handling
-> Implement session management across page navigation to maintain user state
-> Test complete user workflow: login, view homepage, create team, provide feedback, logout
-> Verify database operations are working correctly and data persists between sessions
-> Add loading states and user feedback for all database operations
-> Implement basic rate limiting to prevent abuse during testing phase
-> Test authentication flow thoroughly including edge cases like denied permissions

Step 8 - Deployment Strategy Implementation
-> For Flask+ngrok: Configure ngrok for stable public URL and test external access
-> Set up production environment variables and ensure security best practices
-> Test application performance under simulated user load
-> Implement basic monitoring and health check endpoints
-> Configure proper CORS settings if needed for cross-origin requests
-> Document deployment process and create simple deployment scripts
-> Plan migration path to Vercel for future scaling when ready for production traffic
Tradeoff Analysis: Flask+ngrok offers faster initial development with Python familiarity but requires manual server management. Vercel provides better production infrastructure but adds complexity for Python backend integration. Start with Flask for MVP speed, then migrate to Vercel when scaling needs justify the additional setup complexity.
